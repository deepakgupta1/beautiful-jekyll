Bias Vs variance is considered a very basic concept in data science and is easy to understand but tough to keep track in implementations. Bias and variance are like two pans of a weighing balance, you can adjust one at the cost of other. Clear understanding of this concept is crucial for diagnosis of models.
In this article I am going to explain all nuances of bias, variance and their tradeoff vis-Ã -vis Machine learning and Deep learning.
